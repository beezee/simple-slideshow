<p>The following default options can be set for the Simple Slideshow plugin:</p>

<p><b>Image Size</b>: The dimensions of the images that will be used when displaying a slide show. To adjust these, go 
to the 'Media' control panel, under 'Settings'.</p>

<p><b>Transition Speed</b>: The amount of time, in miliseconds, it will take to fade between individual photos in the slideshow. For a 
quick fade, try entering 150. For a slow fade, try entering 500. Values between 10 and 1000 are valid. </p> 

<p><b>Click Image</b>: If this is enabled, clicking the current sldieshow image will open a new browser window showing the 
full-size version of the image. If this is disabled, clicking the current slideshow image will have no effect.</p>

<p><b>Link Target</b>: If <i>click image</i> is disabled, this option has no effect. If <i>click image</i> is enabled, this option
selects how the full-sized image will be displayed - either the themed Wordpress attachment page will be displayed, or the unstyled 
image directly.</p>
